Create virtualenv
Add stemming to tf-idf
Create SOM (b) just by connecting all with all and playing with settings in Gephi
--> or rank along PCA-1, then within each band of PCA-1, along PCA-2. Then plot as squares, potentally using size and colour as other dimensions (color = first tag or topic, size = shares?)
Create test to measure recall of TF-IDF vs. related content / story bunches so I can assess how well TF-IDF is doing
Create function to filter articles by variables (e.g. date ranges, tags, etc.)
Tidy code and create functionality so that all versions are saved in a folder (e.g. UK, date-range, etc.)
